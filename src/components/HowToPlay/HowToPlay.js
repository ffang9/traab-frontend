                            In Two Rooms and a Boom there are <span className="b">2 teams and 2 rooms</span>. 
                            The 2 teams are the <span className="dark-blue b">Blue Team</span> and the <span className="dark-red b">Red Team</span>. 
                            The <span className="dark-blue b">Blue Team has a President</span>. 
                            The <span className="dark-red b">Red Team has a Bomber</span>. Players are first equally distributed between 
                            2 separate rooms and then each player is randomly assigned a role.

                            Players play the game by saying what they want in order to select a <span className="b">leader</span> for their room. 
                            The leader chooses <span className="b">hostages</span> (players who will be sent to the other room at the end of the round).

                            The game usually consists of <span className="b">3 timed rounds</span>. Each round is shorter than the previous round. 
                            At the end of each round, the hostages selected by the leaders will be traded into opposing rooms.
